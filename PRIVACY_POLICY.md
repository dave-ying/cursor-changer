# Privacy Policy for Cursor Changer

**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Cursor Changer ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our desktop application (the "App").

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Cursor Changer is an offline desktop application designed to customize your mouse cursor. It functions entirely locally on your device.

-   **No Analytics:** We do not track how you use the App.
-   **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account to use the App.
-   **No Internet Usage for Data:** The App does not connect to the internet to send usage data or personal information to us or any third parties.

## 2. Local Data Storage

The App may store settings and preferences (Active Cursor, Library Cursors) locally on your device to preserve your configuration between sessions. This data resides solely on your computer and is not accessible to us.

## 3. Microsoft Store Requirements

The specific capabilities declared in our application manifest (such as `internetClient`) are standard requirements for the underlying framework (WebView2/Tauri) to function correctly on the Windows platform (e.g., for rendering the user interface). These capabilities are not used to collect or transmit personal data.
